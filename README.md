# AdventureGame
Choose Your Own Unity adventure




# Overview

This project was used to push my knownledge of Unity and scenemanagement. I created a plan by mapping out the scenes and flow, then implemented it into the game. It was a great learning experience.

This is a short but rich little choose your own adcenture game. With and inventory that effects outcomes depending on what you have.

I wanted to create something a bit more exciting in Unity. Something that felt polished and complete. I also wanted to gather some experience with post processing and stylization.
